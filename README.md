Features:

- Mock the data endpoints in a way that you feel more comfortable with (e.g. use Content Providers or simple Java objects) so the screen can get the data from them.
- Support Adverts having more than one picture
- Support the feature of sharing an Advert
- Handle rotation
- Make sure screen is optimized for different android screen sizes

Keep in mind:

- Use of new android design patterns and/or libraries
- Gumtree app is built on: MVP, RXJava, Dagger2, Gradle, Espresso, Glide, etc.
- Easy to read and testable code
