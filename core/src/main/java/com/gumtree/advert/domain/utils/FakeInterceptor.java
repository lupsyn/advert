Larson and his Battlestar Galactica's Cylons), and 'molecular bonded shell' body armor, portrayed to be invulnerable to diamond headed drills, small arms fire, the impact of thrown objects, and even high speed impact with cinder block wall. The armor could also resist close explosive blasts although a direct hit could cause severe damage. A refit in the 1985 season included the addition of Super Pursuit Mode and a convertible top. The car's voice was supplied by actor William Daniels.\","
